#DIY AMAZON DASH ALIKE WITH INTEL EDISON

This is a hardware project which was taken and completed by me and my partner in INTEL IOT Hackathon.
Function : Developed a DIY Clone of Amazon dash to order a particular product online by pressing the AMAZON dash like Button.
Below is the link to my instructable and the youtube video.

Description: This project demonstrates the concept of marketing in Internet of things. Suppose the customer buys samsung washing machine which has a built in feature to order washing powder online. The only limitation is you are forced to buy “Tide” which is ordered only through amazon. Tide and amazon will have to pay some amount to samsung as they brought some customers to them. Internet of things marketing can be a very powerful tool in feature. This prototype exactly demonstrates IOT marketing. A small button is connected to intel edison’s GPIO pin. When this button is pressed as intel edison is connected to internet it sends http post request to sparkfun’s database
server which contains the order details like time of order, quantity. This database can be shared with ecommerce website thus completing the merchant side of cycle. The webserver running on Intel edison is made using Node.js.



Technology: Node.js, Intel Edison, Electronics circuit design, Linux
